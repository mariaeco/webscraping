# ðŸ“Œ Webscraping UFPB Resolutions


Here we performed a web scraping on ufpb resolutions, available here "https://sigrh.ufpb.br/sigrh/public/colegiados/filtro_busca.jsf".

The web scraping is found in the scraper.py file.

Additionally the data was processed:
    Converts non-standard files, transforms HTML into PDF, performs OCR of non-editable PDFs. The UFPB resolutions database is not standardized, containing files in PDF, non-editable PDF, HTML, HTM, DOC, requiring standardization to PDF.


Used libriries:

    requests
