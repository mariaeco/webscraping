# ðŸ“Œ Webscraping Bidding Exemptions in the State of ParaÃ­ba


Here we performed a web scraping of the bidding waivers between the years 2018 to 2024 available on the ParaÃ­ba Transparency Portal "https://transparencia.pb.gov.br/relatorios/?rpt=licitacoes".

The web scraping is found in the scraping.py file.

Additionally the data was processed:
- first joining the data of the years:
    
        data_join.csv
- then we standardized the data:

        data_standardization.ipynb file

    In standardization, 
    
    First unified the departments and agencies by the main acronyms.

    Second, we standardized the bidding objects using an <span style="color:#FF5733;">*AI agent*</span>.
    The AI agent is working well needs improvement.


Scraping is slow, as access to the site takes a long time and its server goes down a lot, in addition to several non-standardizations in the data structure. But it is working even with brute force.

Used libriries:

    requests
    selenium
    openpyxl
    openai
    pandas
    glob
